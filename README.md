About
=====

This browser extension helps notify you when a form on a webpage containing password fields has been loaded using an insecure connection.

When forms are loaded using HTTP rather than HTTPS all the data you submit introduces the risk of being intercepted by a malicious attacker that can then steal and use your information.

It is very likely that you use the same email and password combination on many sites, if the attacker intercepts and steals your password they may be able to gain access to your email or other personal accounts.

This extension does not stop you from submitting the form but it does allow you to make an informed decision about the password you are submitting.
